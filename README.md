# Spiking-Neural-Simulator-A-Hypermap-Implementation
Simulator uses spiking neural networks with leaky integrate-and-fire models. Incorporates hypermap theory, suggesting cognition emerges from neural oscillations on a high-dimensional manifold. Spikes are encoded as interfering waveforms. Models cognitive outcomes from neural activity interactions with an informational hypermap.
